check_cuda
==========

This is a simple Nagios plugin to check and make sure that at least one
Nvidia GPU is available through CUDA on the system.

You need to have CUDA installed and working (as well as a CUDA-supported
GPU).

Just run `make` to compile the program then copy it to an appropriate
location.
